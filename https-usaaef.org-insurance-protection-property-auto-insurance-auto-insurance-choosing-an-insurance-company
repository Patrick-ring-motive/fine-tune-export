Honor, integrity, and stability aren’t just great character traits for a Service member. They’re also great attributes to have in your insurance company.
What to Look For
Auto insurance can be expensive, especially for younger drivers. Consequently, it’s smart to look at several providers to compare coverage options and costs.
Tip: Be aware that standard policies and coverage amounts can vary from company to company. Cheaper is not always better, and sometimes, you get what you pay for. 
When selecting an insurance provider, make sure to choose one that is:
Reputable
Financially sound
Customer-focused
Lower auto insurance rates can quickly become a financial defeat if your provider can’t or won’t pay when you need them to, so it’s smart to consider more than just premium costs when picking a provider.

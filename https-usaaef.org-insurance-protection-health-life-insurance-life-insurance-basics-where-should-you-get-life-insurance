There are two common life insurance options: Employer-provided or self-purchased through an insurance company.
Employer-Provided vs. Personally-Purchased
Should you get your life insurance through your employer? On your own? Both?
The best answer depends on your specific situation, but here’s a quick comparison of these two widely used approaches to purchasing life insurance.
Employer-Provided
Personally-Purchased
Pros:
Often does not require medical testing
Lower cost than comparable individual policy
Paid for directly from paycheck (sometimes with pretax dollars)
Pros:
Can stay in force for a lifetime
Not dependent on employment status
Higher potential cost stability over time
Cons:
Often ends with employment
If convertible to individual policy, can often be too expensive to maintain
Cons:
Often requires medical testing
Can be expensive depending on the type and amount
One Size Does Not Fit All
This doesn’t have to be an either/or scenario — there really is no one right answer.
The most conservative approach would be to avoid relying on employer-provided coverage since it could end unexpectedly, leaving you with no coverage and a need to buy individual coverage at a potentially very high price at a very inconvenient time.
On the otherhand, covering your life insurance needs on your own could be too expensive given how much individual coverage costs in comparison to employer-provided coverage.
Tip: A hybrid approach of having employer-provided and personally-purchased life insurance can be a good solution. Individual coverage can be purchased for the amount of protection deemed absolutely necessary, and employer-provided coverage can be used used for the rest.

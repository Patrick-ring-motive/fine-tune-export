Frequently Asked Questions
What are the main benefits of investing? 
Investing can help you combat Inflation, give you potential for higher returns, and help you reach your financial goals. 
How is investing different than saving? 
Saving is designed for short-term goals and needs to be easily accessible and safe. It is typically accumulated in a bank savings account or a money market deposit account. Investing helps with your long-term goals and involves taking calculated risks for the potential for higher returns.
What are the four main asset classes? 
The four main asset classes are cash, bonds, equities, and alternative investments. 
What is a mutual fund and how is it different than an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)? 
A mutual fund is made up of money collected from many investors and used to purchase investments like cash, bonds, stocks, and other assets. Each fund has a specific investment objective and is managed by professional money managers to generate capital gains or income for the fundâ€™s investors. Exchange-Traded Funds share similar traits to mutual funds, but the main difference is how they&#8217;re priced, purchased, and sold. Mutual funds are required by law to price their shares at the end of each business day and orders transact after the major U.S. exchanges close. ETF&#8217;s trade on a stock market with continuous pricing and orders transact throughout the day.
What is the risk reward relationship? 
Risk is an essential component of investing and is often a tradeoff for potential return. In general, the higher the risk, the greater potential for return.

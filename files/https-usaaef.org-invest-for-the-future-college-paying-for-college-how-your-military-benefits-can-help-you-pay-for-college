Military service comes with some great education benefits. Learn to make the most of the perks you&#8217;ve earned.
Many of the education benefits apply to Service members still in uniform, and others remain available after you transition to the civilian world. Here’s the breakdown.
Tuition Assistance
Tuition Assistance (TA) is a benefit paid to eligible active-duty Service members and members of the Guard and Reserve pursuing education goals during off-duty periods. Each service maintains a TA program and sets specific eligibility criteria. Benefits are paid directly to the school but are limited to $250 per semester credit hour and $4,500 annually.
Eligible Programs include:
Accredited online or in-person courses
High school diploma
Vocational, technical and certification programs
Associate’s, bachelor’s, or master’s degree
Learn more about the TA program.
GI Bill Benefits
The GI Bill is one of the best education benefits available to Service members. It can help you, or your dependents under certain conditions, pay for college tuition, job training and certifications. These benefits are typically used once you separate from service, since Tuition Assistance (TA) is a great benefit to use while still in uniform.
The Post-9/11 GI Bill
This bill pays all tuition and fee payments for an in-state student or up to $26,381.37 per academic year for a private or foreign school. Tuition payments are made directly to your school. You may also be eligible for a monthly housing allowance and stipend for books and supplies. Benefits can be transferred to qualified dependents under certain conditions. Visit the VA website to transfer your benefits.
The Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (MGIB-AD) and Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR)
These bills currently pay up to $2,210 per month to help meet education and training costs. Payments are made directly to you. Montgomery GI Bill benefits are not transferable to dependents.

The GI Bill Kicker
Also referred to as the Navy, Army or Marine Corps College Funds, these service branches offer the GI Bill Kicker as a part of your reenlistment or enlistment contract. These are additional dollars to boost your basic monthly GI Bill disbursements. The amount you receive will depend on several factors such as your branch of service, the location of service, your job, enlistment date and the tenure of your enlistment contract.
For more details of each GI Bill program, to apply for benefits or to discuss your specific situation visit the VA website or call (888) 442-4551.
CLEP Exams
One of the best ways Service members can get a head start on college is the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP). This test-for-credit program has been used for over 50 years and is accepted by over 2,900 colleges and universities.
Passing one CLEP exam can earn you the equivalent of 3 to 12 hours of college credit
The military pays for CLEP exams for all Service members
15 CLEP credits applied toward a degree could save up to $17,000 depending on the type of school
Schools decide how much CLEP credits they will accept
Key Takeaway: Test out of certain classes and save money by using your real-life experience to acquire college credit.
Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program
This program provides education and training to dependents of veterans who are permanently and totally disabled due to a service-related condition, or veterans who die on active duty OR as a result of a service-related condition.
For those who qualify, a monthly payment* will be sent to you directly to cover the cost of:
College or graduate degree programs
Career-training certificate courses
Educational and career counseling
Apprenticeships
On-the-job training
*Current rates can be found on the VA website.
Marine GYSGT John David Fry Scholarship
This program provides benefits to children and surviving spouses of Service members who died in the line of duty, while on active duty after September 10, 2001. For those who qualify, benefits include money for tuition, housing, books and supplies. To apply for benefits, visit the VA website.
Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) Scholarships
Offered at hundreds of colleges nationwide, ROTC allows students to attend school full-time while preparing for a career as a commissioned military officer. Some ROTC cadets qualify for scholarships that are awarded based on merit only—not financial need.
The HEART Act
Thanks to the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008 (HEART), individuals who receive military death gratuities or payments under the Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program can roll their benefit over to a Roth IRA and/or Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA), without the usual restrictions on contribution limits. This money can go a long way in funding a dependent’s higher education expenses.

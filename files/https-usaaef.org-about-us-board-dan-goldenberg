Board Member
Dan Goldenberg was appointed as the executive director for the Call of Duty Endowment and an Activision Blizzard Vice President in 2013. Goldenberg, a retired Navy Captain, brings to the job 27 years of active and reserve military service and two decades of business experience – including serving as a Sr. Vice President at Frost &amp; Sullivan and prior to that as a senior director and practice manager at CEB (now Gartner). Highlights of his military service include four tours as a commanding officer, carrier-based naval flight officer, intelligence officer, and special assistant to four Secretaries of the Navy: John Dalton, Richard Danzig, Robin Pirie and Gordon England.
Under his leadership, the Call of Duty Endowment has risen to become the world’s largest philanthropic funder of veteran employment, backing more than 125,000 high quality job placements at 1/13th the cost per placement of U.S. Department of Labor efforts, and achieving $7.2 billion in economic gains for veterans and their families.
In 2021, Goldenberg founded and assumed leadership of Activision Blizzard’s Corporate Social Responsibility function, which includes responsibility for the company’s sustainability efforts and ESG reporting. Through his leadership, the company calculated and disclosed for the first time its full carbon footprint, disclosing more than any other pure play video game company, while committing to SBTi, reporting to CDP, and embarking on meaningful emission reduction efforts to achieve its Net Zero goal. Also, during his tenure, the Endowment has won numerous national awards, including four Engage for Good Halo Awards, two Youtube Streamys, and Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas Award. He also serves on the George W. Bush Institute Advisory Council.
Goldenberg is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Harvard Business School, National Intelligence University, and the Air Command and Staff College. He has also completed MIT’s Chief Sustainability Officer Program. From his military service, he holds several individual and campaign awards, including the Defense Superior Service Medal.

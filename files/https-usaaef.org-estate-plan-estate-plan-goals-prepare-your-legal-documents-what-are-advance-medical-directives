Have a plan in the event you are unable to communicate your wishes with advance medical directives.
Advance medical directives are documents that state your wishes regarding healthcare decisions in case you’re not able to communicate those wishes.
Common directives include a medical power of attorney to name someone to make medical decisions on your behalf when you can’t and a living will to state your wishes regarding end-of-life care.
These directives are invaluable to your loved ones when they are put in a difficult position. Discuss your wishes with your physician or medical facility to help make an informed decision. With advances in medical technology your directives should be routinely reviewed, especially prior to any major medical procedure.
Tip: Discuss your wishes with your physician or medical facility to help make an informed decision.

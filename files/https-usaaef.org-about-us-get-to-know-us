Our History
Since 1986, The USAA Educational Foundation has served the military community by helping service members and their families become informed financial decision-makers through every life stage.
USAA, the founder and sponsor of The USAA Educational Foundation, is a San Antonio, Texas-based financial services company that provides auto, homeowners, and life insurance products and, banking and investment services.
While USAA is our sponsor, The USAA Educational Foundation does not endorse or promote any commercial supplier, products, or services.
Is The USAA Educational Foundation a part of USAA?
The Educational Foundation is sponsored by USAA, and while both organizations serve the military community, the Foundation acts as a separate organization. It has oversight from an independent board of leaders that serve the military and their families, regardless of USAA membership.
Where do I apply for a grant?
Our Foundation does not make grants, rather it serves its philanthropic mission by providing free financial education materials tailored to the military community. To learn more about our partners, check out our alliances.
Our Alliances
Through alliances with leading organizations serving the military community, we’re able to help more families forge a path toward financial readiness.

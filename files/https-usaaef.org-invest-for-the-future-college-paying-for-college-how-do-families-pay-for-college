College can be expensive, but don’t be discouraged if you can’t save enough to cover the entire cost.
How Do I Pay for College?
Compare the goal of paying for college to another major purchase &#8211; like buying a house. Most buyers can’t afford to pay cash. Instead, they make a down payment and borrow the rest. College is no different.
While you may want to save enough to pay for college, it might require a combination of savings, income, scholarships and student loans to get the job done.
According to Sallie Mae, here is how American families are paying for college:
&nbsp;
Families spent $26,373 on college in AY 2020-21.

56% of families are making payments on student loans while in school, up from 46% in AY 2019-20
Next steps
Calculate your projected college savings amount and compare it to your goal.
Set up an automatic transfer from your bank account that goes into college savings every month.
Consider expanding your savings whenever you pay off a loan or credit card by sending that same payment to your college savings, instead.
Instead of toys, encourage grandparents, family, and friends to contribute to a college savings account when they want to give a gift to your child.
Research credit card reward programs that contribute to your college savings account.

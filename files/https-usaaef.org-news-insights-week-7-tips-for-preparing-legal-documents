Never skip leg day.
And don&#8217;t skip estate planning either. 
This week&#8217;s workout:
Prepare Your Legal Documents
Your estate plan is like a workout program, one that supports all the heavy legal and financial decisions in life.
A will, power of attorney, and other estate planning documents help your loved ones or next of kin navigate the difficult time after your death without added confusion, conflict, or unnecessary cost.
&nbsp;
Exercise 1
Power your estate plan with important legal documents right for you, such as a will, power of attorney, advanced medical directives, trust, and letters of instruction.
Exercise 2
Get a spot from an attorney to help draft your estate planning documents. Check out base legal services.
Exercise 3
Champion your loved ones and favorite causes by naming them as beneficiaries on your retirement accounts and life insurance policies. Also review your record of emergency data (DD Form 93) and family care plan.
&nbsp;
Exercise 4
Don’t leave loved ones in a crunch. Communicate your estate plan with them and let them know their roles.

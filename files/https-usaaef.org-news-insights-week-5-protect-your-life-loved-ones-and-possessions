Fight money mayhem with confidence!
Insurance is excellent financial defense.
This week&#8217;s workout:
Protect Your Life, Loved Ones, and Possessions
Financial empowerment is about more than going on the offensive and building a big bank account or diversified investment portfolio.
You also need a good defense to protect what&#8217;s important: your life, loved ones, and your possessions. Insurance helps with that.
Move 1
Cover the financial needs of those depending on you with a strong life insurance plan. Determine the right amount of coverage using our LIFE calculator.
Move 2
Guard your gear from theft or damage with a Homeowners or Renters (Barracks) policy.
Move 3
Defend your finances from an expensive fender bender with auto insurance. Policies can help cover liability, collision and other costly situations (and can keep you compliant with the law).
Move 4
Protect your personal information from scammers using this helpful Military Consumer Protection guide.

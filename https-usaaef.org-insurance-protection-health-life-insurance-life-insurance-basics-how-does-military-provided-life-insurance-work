Service members have military-provided life insurance options throughout their career and beyond. Military spouses and dependent children also have coverage options.
Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI)
SGLI is automatic group term life insurance for Service members.
All active-duty Service members, most Guard and Reserve members, and certain other military-affiliated individuals are eligible for SGLI. This coverage:
Is automatic (no sign up required)
Provides $500,000 of coverage for about $30 per month (can be reduced in $50,000 increments, if desired)
Is paid for directly from your paycheck
Includes up to $100,000 of Traumatic Injury Protection to help eligible Service members recover from a severe injury incurred while serving
Continues free of charge for 120 days after military separation and can be converted to Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI) or a civilian policy

Tip: It is often a good idea to maintain full SGLI coverage even though you can elect to reduce it. 
Family Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (FSGLI)
Family Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (FSGLI) is available for spouses and dependent children of those covered by full-time SGLI. Spouse coverage up to $100,000 (not to exceed the Service member’s SGLI amount) is available for a premium and dependent children are covered for $10,000 each for no cost.
Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI)
Veterans’ Group Life insurance (VGLI) is available for those covered under SGLI when separating. If applied for within 240 days of separation, proof of good health is not required. However, for those in good health, a private civilian policy might be available for less cost. The amount of VGLI coverage cannot exceed the amount of SGLI coverage in place at the time of separation, however, it can be increased in $25,000 increments every 5 years until age 60 or the $500,000 maximum coverage level is reached.

Whether buying or renting, finding a place to call home is essential regardless of your location or stage of your military career.
A home is much more than a dwelling. It’s your sanctuary, but it‘s also a major financial commitment. For most people, rent or a mortgage payment is their largest monthly expense. So, it should come as no surprise that balancing life’s other monetary commitments with the cost of housing can take some financial finesse.
This is especially true for military families. When it comes to housing options, Service members face unique considerations and challenges. The decision between living on-base or off-base, renting or buying, and embracing the sacrifices that come with frequent moves are all part of the job.
Before making any housing decision, it’s a good idea to take an objective look at your family’s needs, financial situation, plans, and goals for the future.

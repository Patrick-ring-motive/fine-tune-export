Bottom line: you could easily be legally responsible for tens of thousands of dollars of damages.,More Than Just Accident Coverage: Accidents are a common reason for auto insurance claims, but they are not the only negative financial event from which auto insurance can help protect us. Key Takeaway: Insurance can provide protection from certain other vehicle-related expenses like damages caused by vandalism, theft, hail, collision with an animal, and certain natural disasters like fire and flooding.,You May Not Have a Choice: Purchasing auto insurance may not be optional. Most states require drivers to have at least minimum levels of auto insurance (minimums vary by state).

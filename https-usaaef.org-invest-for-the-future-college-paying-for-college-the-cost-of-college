It doesn’t take a college degree to know that college is expensive! Here’s how to get a ballpark estimate of the total cost.
According to recent studies, the average cost of a 4-year degree at a public university is approximately $100,000! This estimate includes tuition, books, room and board, insurance, transportation and other fees. The “sticker shock” that comes with this price tag is free of charge.
Here is some good news. While colleges provide the full “sticker price” to attend their school, the true cost of college will vary from student to student and may be offset by grants or scholarships.

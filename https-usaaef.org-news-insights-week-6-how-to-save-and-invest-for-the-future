Investing for retirement is a marathon so take it one mile at a time.
This week&#8217;s workout:
Save and Invest for the Future
The road to retirement is paved with consistent saving, wise investments, and financial discipline…kind of like running a marathon.
Making small efforts to save today — combined with the power of compound interest — can make a big difference when you cross the finish line at retirement.
But it’s up to you to take the first step.
&nbsp;
Mile 1
Set a consistent pace by saving or investing 10%-15% of your pretax pay for retirement.
Mile 2
Accelerate your investment returns through the power of compound interest.
Mile 3
Power up your retirement contributions when it&#8217;s easier &#8211; after promotions, pay increases or when you&#8217;ve paid off a debt.
&nbsp;
Mile 4
Run your own race. In addition to saving in an employer retirement plan, go the extra mile and consider individual retirement accounts.

      "    \u001b[32m'Avoid Them. The best strategy to paying back a student loan is not needing one in the first place. Explore scholarships, grants, working part-time, military programs, or employer tuition reimbursement programs to help pay for school.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Minimize Them. Once you have exhausted all efforts to avoid student loans, try to minimize the amount you borrow. To save money, consider attending community college before transferring to a public or private institution. Or, consider attending a less expensive college.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Learn Your Options. Visit studentaid.gov for more information about paying for college.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Choose Federal Over Private. If you need to borrow for college, start with federal loans first. Federal loans typically offer lower interest rates and more flexible repayment options than private loans. Federal loans also can be tax deductible, and have the potential to be subsidized or even forgiven under certain conditions.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Complete the FAFSA. All students interested in financial aid should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) annually by October 1.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Understand Repayment Options. Federal student loans offer a number of repayment options, including many that are income-based. Private loans also offer some choices for how to pay back your debt though they are more limited than federal loans. Be sure to work with your lender or loan servicer to determine the repayment options that work best for you.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Consolidate Carefully. Avoid for-profit companies promising to consolidate your loans for a fee. You can often do this yourself. Visit the National Foundation for Credit Counseling for additional information.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",

Auto insurance helps protect your finances from the fallout of accidents and other claims.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'The Basics\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Auto insurance, like all insurances really, is something you pay for and hope you will never need to use. However, having insurance can protect you financially from the costs of replacing or repairing vehicles, paying medical costs, and more. Consequently, having auto insurance is generally a good idea and is usually required.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Accidents Happen\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'No matter how careful we are, accidents do happen. When those accidents involve vehicles, major physical and financial damage can occur.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'To illustrate, imagine the accident pictured was 100% your fault. Let&#8217;s further imagine it destroyed several vehicles and also sent several people to the hospital. Bottom line: you could easily be legally responsible tens of thousands of dollars of damages.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Fortunately, most people will never be the cause of an accident of this magnitude or be financially responsible for the level of damages it could cause. Still, even minor fender benders, which happen all the time, can cause the at-fault party to be financially responsible for substantial damages. Auto insurance can help protect us from such financially damaging situations.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'More Than Just Accident Coverage\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Accidents are a common reason for auto insurance claims, but they are not the only negative financial event from which auto insurance can help protect us.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Key Takeaway: Insurance can provide protection from certain other vehicle-related expenses like damages caused by vandalism, theft, hail, collision with an animal, and certain natural disasters like fire and flooding.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Whatever the cause, damage to a vehicle can be costly to repair, and auto insurance can help protect our finances.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'You May Not Have a Choice\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
      "    \u001b[32m'Purchasing auto insurance may not be optional. Most states require drivers to have at least minimum levels of auto insurance (minimums vary by state). Also, if you lease or finance your vehicle, your lender may have minimum insurance requirements you must maintain as part of the financing agreement.\\n'\u001b[39m +\n",

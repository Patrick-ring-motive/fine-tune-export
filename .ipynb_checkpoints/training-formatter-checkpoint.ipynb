The goal of saving is to preserve the money&#8217;s value, so it&#8217;s readily available when needed without any significant risk of loss. Depending on the type of account, your money could be protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\\xa0or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) up to certain limits.\\nWhat is Investing?\\nInvesting requires that you take calculated risks with your money by buying securities, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, with the hope of earning higher, long-term returns. Investments generally do not offer the safety that a savings account does, so your principal can be at risk. In return, you have the potential for a more rewarding gain.\\nHow Much Can My Money Grow?\\nInvesting a little money now can go a long way in the future!

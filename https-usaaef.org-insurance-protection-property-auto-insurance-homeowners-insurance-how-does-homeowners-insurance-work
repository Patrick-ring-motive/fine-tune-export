If you already own a home, or are shopping for one, you’re going to want (or need) to protect it. Here’s how.
Homeowners Insurance Coverage Basics
There are two main reasons to have homeowners insurance:
It&#8217;s a prudent financial move to make given the high value of your home and possessions, combined with the other protections homeowners insurance offers.
It’s required by lenders since most homeowners finance the purchase of their homes.
You&#8217;re not just insuring your home with a homeowners insurance policy. These policies generally provide protection against losses in all of these coverage categories.
Dwelling
Damage to the building itself and any attached structures
Other structures
Damage to other unattached structures on the property like garages, sheds, and fences
Personal liability
Damages or injury to someone else for which the insured may be responsible
Medical payments
Medical expenses for anyone hurt on the property or by the insured person’s pet
Personal property
Damages to personal property even if that property is not in the home at the time of loss
Loss of use
Expenses associated with living elsewhere while the home is repaired or rebuilt
Depending on your policy and insurance provider, you can often adjust the amounts of coverage within each of these categories to fit your situation.
To be covered by a policy, losses within these categories must be the result of a covered event, or “peril,” as they are known in the insurance world. Common perils covered under standard homeowners insurance policies include:
Fire
Smoke
Windstorm
Hail
Lightning
Weight of snow, ice or sleet
Falling Objects
Civil Unrest
Vehicles
Explosions
Vandalism
Theft
Tip: It’s important to recognize that floods, earthquakes, insect damage and normal wear and tear are generally not covered in a typical homeowners insurance policy. However, protection against floods or earthquakes can be obtained through additional coverage or government insurance programs.

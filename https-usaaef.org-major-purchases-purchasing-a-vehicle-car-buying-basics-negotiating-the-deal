Buying a car often involves negotiating a deal. Use these strategies to avoid being out-maneuvered.
Negotiating your best deal with a salesperson can feel like a high-stakes game of poker. Even if you know the rules of engagement, every move can be mentally exhausting and your opponent is a professional who plays all day, every day. So, how do you stay cool during those critical moments?
This fun video will help you get ready to negotiate like a pro:
Negotiating Tips
Here are a few tips to &#8220;know when to hold &#8217;em and know when to fold &#8217;em.&#8221;
Get preapproved to buy a vehicle through your bank or credit union. This will give you strength in negotiating dealership financing rates and help you know the maximum payment you can afford.
Negotiate outside of the dealership. This is often more effective than at the dealership where inventory, emotions, and the sales environment can contribute to a poor financial decision.
Don’t be drawn into a conversation with a salesperson about monthly payments. Focus instead on the total price you are willing to pay for the vehicle. Your goal is to get a good total cost deal, not just a good monthly payment.
Know the value of any trade-in based on its condition before you go shopping. Then, negotiate the trade-in price as a separate transaction.
Research competitors’ pricing and factory invoice pricing — the actual cost to the dealer for that vehicle — to gain an upper hand.
Consider getting a Pre-Purchase Inspection (PPI) on used vehicles. A PPI is a vehicle inspection performed by a licensed mechanic or auto technician who will give the vehicle a thorough inspection to determine its cosmetic, mechanical and safety condition. Knowledge is power and having all the facts about the vehicle you are buying can help you negotiate a better price.
Review the vehicle history report.
Does the vehicle have a questionable accident or repair history?
Has the vehicle been on the dealer lot for months?
Is a private seller flipping the vehicle after a short period of ownership?
The answers to these questions can be found in a vehicle history report and give you leverage in negotiating a deal.

The military is committed to taking care of families, including survivors. As a surviving family member, you have a range of benefits and services available to help you cope with your loss – both the emotional impact and the financial implications. Your actual benefits will vary depending on a number of factors, but the information shown below is a sampling of what may be available to you.
Casualty Assistance is local guidance and assistance that helps you receive appropriate benefits and entitlements.
Burial Benefits provided by the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs ensure eligible Service members receive recognition and a dignified burial.
Death Gratuity is a lump sum tax-exempt payment of $100,000 to a selected beneficiary.
Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) offers a life insurance death benefit up to $500,000 as a lump sum or in 36 monthly installments, if elected.
Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) is a tax-exempt benefit generally payable to a surviving spouse, child or parent of a Service member who dies on active duty or training. It may also apply to survivors of veterans who die from a service-connected disability.
Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) may benefit the surviving spouse and/or child of a Service member who dies on active duty. There is a Reserve Component SBP (RC-SBP) for reservists on active duty or in a drilling/duty status, or if RC-SBP coverage was selected when they became retirement-eligible.
Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act (HEART) provides tax and pension benefits to survivors when the Service member dies on active duty.
Social Security Survivors Benefits may be available to surviving spouses and children under the age of 18.
Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA) offers education and training opportunities to eligible dependents of Service members who die or become disabled while on active duty.
Fry Scholarship offers scholarships to eligible spouses and children of Service members who die in the line of duty on or after Sept. 11, 2001.
Key Takeaway: There are two comprehensive resources that can help survivors navigate benefits: Military OneSource is a Department of Defense program that will connect you to survivor support, and the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) is a national nonprofit that provides compassionate care and resources for those grieving the death of a Service member or veteran. For Reserve Component Service members, benefits eligibility rules are complex and may be available only when you are on active duty or Inactive Duty for Training.

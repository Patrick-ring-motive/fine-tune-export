Understanding your consumer rights and protections is a very important part of your financial well-being. And it’s even more important to those serving in the military.
Scammers are everywhere these days. There are always people who try to take advantage of others for financial gain. Stay aware — learn about what you can do to protect yourself as a consumer and Service member.
Military Consumer Protection Laws
There are two important consumer protection laws designed specifically for Service members, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) and the Military Lending Act (MLA). Both laws protect Service members on active duty and active members of the Guard and Reserve on Title 10 orders.
SCRA protections include:
Ability to terminate cell phone, cable, and internet contracts
Termination of residential and auto leases
Postponement of foreclosures and evictions
Installment contract protection
6% interest rate cap on debts incurred before active duty
Stay of certain civil court proceedings
Delay of enforcement related to certain taxes, including personal and real property taxes
Life insurance coverage protections
MLA protections include:
36% interest rate cap on most types of consumer loans
No mandatory waivers of consumer protection laws
No mandatory allotments
No prepayment penalty
The Fair Credit Reporting Act now requires the nationwide consumer reporting agencies to provide free credit monitoring for active-duty military consumers. Sign up with the credit reporting agencies at their websites below:

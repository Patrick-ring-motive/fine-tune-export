The USAA Educational Foundation is committed to innovative and engaging financial education, and that commitment has recently been recognized. The Foundation was awarded a trio of Telly Awards® for their groundbreaking edutainment series Car Buying Basics. The series, tailored to Service members and their families, covers essential topics related to purchasing a new or used vehicle. You can check out all five videos in the Car Buying Basics learning guide.
The Telly Awards® are a prestigious honor in the world of video and television content that celebrate excellence in storytelling across various mediums. Car Buying Basics received awards in the non-broadcast categories of Craft-Directing, General-Information and Use of Comedy.
“Financial education is an essential life skill, but it’s often caught not taught” says Steve Georgoulakis, CFP® co-writer/producer of the series. He further explains “Your money influences, for better or worse, probably came from family, friends, and culture. An educational series like Car Buying Basics gives everyone a solid baseline when it comes to understanding one of the biggest financial decisions a Service member will make. “
It’s the educational and entertaining approach that sets Car Buying Basics apart from traditional educational videos. “In a world where attention spans are shrinking, Car Buying Basics reminds us of the power of infusing education with entertainment”, says Scott Halliwell, CFP® co-writer/producer of the series.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do I need auto insurance? 
Most states require drivers to have at least a minimum level of auto insurance (minimums vary by state). Lenders also usually require borrowers to have auto insurance, so if you financed or leased your vehicle, you may not have a choice but to maintain coverage.
Do I need homeowners insurance? 
If you own a home, then yes, you probably need homeowners insurance. This is especially true if you took out a mortgage to buy it, because lenders usually require it. Either way, having homeowners insurance is still usually a good idea when you consider how much it would cost to repair or replace a home and all its contents.
Do I need renters insurance? 
Sometimes it’s required, and other times it’s just a good idea. Renters insurance typically includes property and liability coverage. Property coverage can provide money to replace or repair your damaged property if the loss is the result of certain causes. And liability coverage can protect your finances if you’re ever found legally liable for damages incurred at your rental or damages otherwise deemed to be your fault. Your landlord’s insurance typically only protects their building, not you or your property.
Is all property insurance the same? 
No. While each type of property and casualty insurance (homeowners, renters, auto, etc.) generally offers the same basic types of protection, most coverage can be customized to your specific situation. For example, you can often select from a range of deductibles (the amount you’re responsible to cover on a claim) and a range of protection amounts.  
What is an umbrella policy?
An umbrella policy is a type of insurance coverage that adds extra liability protection against claims that exceed the limits of your auto and homeowners insurance. In effect, it’s coverage that provides an extra layer or “umbrella” of liability protection against lawsuits, claims or judgments. Coverage is typically offered in increments of $1 million and is relatively inexpensive compared to the added protection it provides.

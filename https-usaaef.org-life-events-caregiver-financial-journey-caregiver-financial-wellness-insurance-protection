Insurance can help ease potential financial loss and stress for you and the person you care for.
Protecting your life, loved ones, and possessions is both a commitment and an act of love. Insurance is an important ally in this mission – especially for caregivers. It can’t stop life’s tough moments from happening, but insurance can help ease potential financial loss and stress, protecting both you and the person you care for.
As you compare options for different types of insurance, you&#8217;ll quickly find that a higher deductible can lower your monthly premiums. Remember to make sure you have the money available to pay that deductible if you ever need to file a claim.

Property &amp; Auto Insurance
Homeowners, renters, and auto insurance are valuable components of your overall protection plan. Caregivers particularly should consider:
If you’ve made modifications to your home to accommodate a disability such as wheelchair ramps, widened doorways, or bathroom accessibility, it’s important to make sure your policy covers them.
If you drive another person’s vehicle as part of their care, make sure you are covered in case of an accident.
If you have medical equipment or have made vehicle modifications (wheelchair lifts, hand controls, etc.), be sure they are covered.

Health Insurance
This journey can be a challenging one, so it’s important to prioritize your physical and mental health. Health insurance helps to cover medical costs and can be obtained through employers, government programs, the Health Insurance Marketplace, private providers, or family plans.
As a caregiver for a veteran, you should also factor in:
CHAMPVA
The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) is a comprehensive health care program for the spouse or widow(er) and children of an eligible Veteran. Through CHAMPVA, the VA shares the cost of certain health care services and supplies with eligible beneficiaries.
Respite care
Respite care provides a short-term break for primary caregivers, giving you some time away from your daily routine. While most health insurance policies do not cover the cost of respite care, certain qualifying veterans may be eligible for assistance through the VA Caregiver Support Program. Visit Hidden Hero Respite Resources to find additional respite care services.
Healthcare emergency plan
A healthcare emergency plan doesn’t insure anything, but it does ensure you can get urgent medical care for yourself and not leave the person you care for without necessary support.
Though most caregivers do an amazing job of coordinating care for their loved ones, they all too often neglect their own healthcare and health emergency plan. Keep open lines of communication with your providers and work with family and friends to develop a plan for medical emergencies, should one arise.
 
Disability Insurance
While caregiving can be a full-time job, it may not be your only career. If you are employed, disability insurance provides income protection in the event that you become disabled. Both of the following types of insurance can be obtained through employers or private providers.
Short-term disability insurance

Life Insurance
Life insurance is a way to financially take care of loved ones when we’re no longer here to do it ourselves. Beyond the considerations we all face, caregivers should take particular care in selecting the appropriate beneficiary of their life insurance policy as funds will be distributed according to the policy and not your will.
Note that naming the person you care for as your beneficiary could affect their eligibility for disability-related benefits, healthcare coverage, or housing assistance. Speak to an attorney to understand options and implications for your specific situation. As you set up your plan, also consider:
Insurance needs
There are many ways to calculate the amount of life insurance you need, including the use of a simple acronym, LIFE. LIFE stands for liabilities to be paid off, so survivors are not left with the burden of paying them, income needed to financially support survivors, final expenses such as funeral costs, and education and other future goals for survivors.
Term vs. permanent coverage
Choose the right type of life insurance policy for your situation. Term insurance is typically less expensive and provides coverage for a specific number of years. Permanent insurance is typically more expensive but is designed to be lifelong coverage with a cash value component.
 
Long-Term Care Insurance
When it comes to protecting your finances, it’s important to prepare for your future well-being. Long-term care insurance covers expenses related to extended care services such as in-home care, assisted living, and skilled nursing facilities. Coverage is typically offered through private insurance providers.
Premiums are based in part on your age and medical condition at the time of enrollment in a policy. They become more expensive as you get older. A person who already lives in an assisted living or skilled nursing facility, or needs help with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, or using the toilet, is not likely to qualify for a new long term care policy.

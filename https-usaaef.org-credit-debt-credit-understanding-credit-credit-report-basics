What makes up a credit report?
Your credit report is a valuable tool that can help you build, track, maintain, and protect your credit reputation. This record of your payment history is often used to determine your financial dependability.
Each person has their own report. If you share joint debts with someone else, that debt will appear on each of your individual reports. Credit reports typically contain four sections:
Identifying information like your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth.
Credit accounts show who you owe money to, the amount, terms of the loan, and payment history. Pay close attention to the accounts and payment history to ensure they’re correct. You may also see accounts here that are closed, since most payment history stays on your credit report for at least seven years.
Credit inquiries such as how often have you applied for credit and for how much.
Collections and public records including any past-due accounts that have been turned over to a collection agency and credit-related public records like bankruptcies.
Key Takeaway: These four categories of information tell the story of your credit history to others, so make sure your story is accurate.

You can request a report from one agency or all three. The format of each agency’s report may differ, but the information conveyed should be the same. Requesting your credit report is not considered a credit inquiry so it will not negatively impact your credit score.
If you find inaccurate information, inform the lender and reporting agency right away. Carefully review for identity errors or inaccurate reporting of debts including payment, balance amount, or credit limit. Mistakes happen but errors can also be a sign of identity theft.

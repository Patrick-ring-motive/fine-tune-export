Discovering that your identity has been stolen can be a stressful experience, but here are a few steps to minimize and repair the damage.
If Someone Steals Your Identity
Sound the alarm
Immediately notify your financial institutions and close any fraudulently opened accounts.
Break the news
Notify the three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.
Freeze them out
Place a fraud alert and credit freeze on your account.
Fight back
File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at idenitytheft.gov and make a recovery plan.
Stay on high alert
Stay vigilant and continue to monitor your accounts, credit reports, and mail.

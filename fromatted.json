    ["Spare Change Calculator \nif (document.readyState === 'loading') {\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\niFrameResize({ log: true }, '#fin-embed-3103');\n});\n} else {\niFrameResize({ log:false}, '#fin-embed-3103');\n}\nAll Calculators"]

     [/INST] ```json

{

  "data": [

    {

      "request": "Retrieve the URL for the USAA Spare Change Calculator.",

      "response": "https://usaaef.org/tools/calculator/spare-change-calculator"

    },

    {

      "request": "Extract and describe the JavaScript snippet related to the Spare Change Calculator.",

      "response": "The JavaScript snippet is used to load an iframe element with the ID 'fin-embed-3103' asynchronously. It checks if the document is already loaded before attempting to resize the iframe. If the document is loading, it adds an event listener for 'DOMContentLoaded' to ensure the iframe is resized once the document is fully loaded. If the document is not loading, it directly resizes the iframe without waiting for the document to load."

    }

  ]

}

```

Note: The JSON provided focuses on the key pieces of information from the raw data and formats them into a structured request/response pair for LLM training. The JavaScript snippet is described rather than directly quoted, as the original request was for JSON formatting. If the exact JavaScript code is required, it should be included verbatim, but it would not be in JSON format. JSON is used for structured data, and the description of the JavaScript snippet fits the JSON structure for training purposes. If you need the JavaScript code in JSON format, it would be represented as a string within the "response" field. However, JSON does not support direct inclusion of JavaScript code without proper formatting. Here's how you might represent it:

```json

{

  "request": "Retrieve the JavaScript snippet for the Spare Change Calculator.",

  "response": "\"\"\"\nif (document.readyState === 'loading') {\n    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n        iFrameResize({ log: true }, '#fin-embed-3103');\n    });\n} else {\n    iFrameResize({ log: false }, '#fin-embed-3103');\n\"\"\"\n"

}

```

This approach keeps the JSON structure intact while including the JavaScript code as a string. However, please note that including raw code in JSON for training purposes is unconventional and might not be directly applicable for all LLM training scenarios. The description approach is more common for JSON training data.
<s>[INST] Please help me format the following information for llm training. This information is taken from the USAA informational website.

    }
  ]
}
```

Note: The JSON provided encapsulates the request and response in a single pair, as per the format requirement. However, since the raw data includes multiple pieces of information, it's represented in a way that could be used for training an LLM to understand and process similar requests and responses. If multiple data points are needed for training, they could be structured in an array of objects within the "data" key. Here's an example with multiple data points:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "request": "Retrieve the URL and content description for the USAA educational website cart feature.",
      "response": "URL: https://usaaef.org/for-educators/order-publications/cart\nContent: ['Cart\nYour cart is currently empty. \nReturn to shop']"

      "response": "The content describes the cart feature on the USAA educational website, indicating that the cart is currently empty and providing a return option."
    }
  ]
}
```

This format allows for multiple training examples to be provided in a structured manner.

}
```

Note: The actual JSON response should include the raw data as strings within the "response" field, but for the sake of this example, I've provided a structured representation of the data. In practice, you would need to encode the raw data as strings within the JSON. Here's how you might represent the raw data as strings:

```json

{

  "data": [

    {

      "request": "Retrieve the URL and content related to USAA Educational Foundation's Telly Awards from the provided USAA informational website.",

      "response": "URL: https://usaaef.org/news-insights/category/award-wins-recognition\nContent: ['The USAA Educational Foundation Scores Three Telly Awards®!Friday September 22, 2023 \nThe USAA Educational Foundation is committed to innovative and engaging financial education, and that commitment has recently been recognized.

    }
  ]
}
```

In this JSON, the "Content" field would contain an array of strings, each representing a line from the original content. If you need to include the raw data as it is, you would need to encode each string within the array. Here's an example of how you might encode the raw data:

```json

{

  "data": [

    {

      "request": "Retrieve the URL and content related to USAA Educational Foundation's Telly Awards from the provided USAA informational website.",

      "response": "URL: https://usaaef.org/news-insights/category/award-wins-recognition\nContent: [\"The USAA Educational Foundation Scores Three Telly Awards®!\", \"Friday September 22, 2023 \", \"The USAA Educational Foundation is committed to innovative and engaging financial education, and that commitment has recently been recognized.

    Content:
    ["Student loans are a hot topic of late, so here are a few tips to get schooled on the subject.\nAvoid Them. The best strategy to paying back a student loan is not needing one in the first place. Explore scholarships, grants, working part-time, military programs, or employer tuition reimbursement programs to help pay for school.\nMinimize Them. Once you have exhausted all efforts to avoid student loans, try to minimize the amount you borrow. To save money, consider attending community college before transferring to a public or private institution. Or, consider attending a less expensive college.\nLearn Your Options. Visit studentaid.gov for more information about paying for college.\nChoose Federal Over Private. If you need to borrow for college, start with federal loans first. Federal loans typically offer lower interest rates and more flexible repayment options than private loans. Federal loans also can be tax deductible, and have the potential to be subsidized or even forgiven under certain conditions.\nComplete the FAFSA. All students interested in financial aid should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) annually by October 1.\nUnderstand Repayment Options. Federal student loans offer a number of repayment options, including many that are income-based. Private loans also offer some choices for how to pay back your debt though they are more limited than federal loans. Be sure to work with your lender or loan servicer to determine the repayment options that work best for you.\nConsolidate Carefully. Avoid for-profit companies promising to consolidate your loans for a fee. You can often do this yourself. Visit the National Foundation for Credit Counseling\xa0for additional information.\nIn This Guide\nPaying for College\nBenefits of Higher Education\nEducational Article\nThe Cost of College\nEducational Article\nHow Do Families Pay For College?\nEducational Article\nHow Much Do I Need to Save For College?\nCalculator\nSaving &#038; Investing for College\nEducational Article\nEducation Benefits of Serving\nVideo\nHow Your Military Benefits Can Help You Pay for College\nEducational Article\nUnderstanding Financial Aid &#038; Student Loans\nEducational Article\nTop Tips for Student Loans\nEducational Article\nGreat Job\nYou've Completed the Guide\nPaying for College Guide\nReturn to College"]

    ['Vehicles can be expensive to repair and can cause a lot of costly damage when involved in an accident. Auto insurance helps protect your finances from the fallout of accidents and other claims.\nThe Basics\nAuto insurance, like all insurances really, is something you pay for and hope you will never need to use. However, having insurance can protect you financially from the costs of replacing or repairing vehicles, paying medical costs, and more. Consequently, having auto insurance is generally\xa0a good idea and is usually required.\nAccidents Happen\nNo matter how careful we are, accidents do happen. When those accidents involve vehicles, major physical and financial damage can occur.\nTo illustrate, imagine the accident pictured was 100% your fault. Let&#8217;s further imagine it destroyed several vehicles and also sent several people to the hospital. Bottom line: you could easily be legally responsible tens of thousands of dollars of damages.\nFortunately, most people will never be the cause of an accident of this magnitude or be financially responsible for the level of damages it could cause. Still, even minor fender benders, which happen all the time, can cause the at-fault party to be financially responsible for substantial damages. Auto insurance can help protect us from such financially damaging situations.\nMore Than Just Accident Coverage\nAccidents are a common reason for auto insurance claims, but they are not the only negative financial event from which auto insurance can help protect us.\nKey Takeaway: Insurance can provide protection from certain other vehicle-related expenses like damages caused by vandalism, theft, hail, collision with an animal, and certain natural disasters like fire and flooding.\nWhatever the cause, damage to a vehicle can be costly to repair, and auto insurance can help protect our finances.\nYou May Not Have a Choice\nPurchasing auto insurance may not be optional. Most states require drivers to have at least minimum levels of auto insurance (minimums vary by state). Also, if you lease or finance your vehicle, your lender may have minimum insurance requirements you must maintain as part of the financing agreement.\nIn This Guide\nAuto Insurance\nWhy Do I Need Auto Insurance?\nEducational Article\nHow Does Auto Insurance Work?\nEducational Article\nAuto Insurance Coverage Components\nEducational Article\nAuto Insurance Costs: Premiums and Deductibles\nEducational Article\nChoosing an Insurance Company\nEducational Article\nUp Next\nHow Does Auto Insurance Work?\nPart 2 of 5 in the \nAuto Insurance Guide\nContinue to the Next Section']

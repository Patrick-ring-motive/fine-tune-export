Stuff happens when you least expect it. Here’s how to put protection in place so a minor expense doesn’t become a major debt headache.
Watch the video for Step 2, then learn how to build a safety net of your own.
The Keys to Success
Build a safety net of $1,000 to pay for emergencies. Build it ASAP.
Understand that a fully-funded emergency fund is typically three to six months of living expenses, but when getting out of debt, $1,000 is enough to cover many financial setbacks.
Do not borrow to build this cushion.
Tip from Steve Georgoulakis, CFP®
It might feel counterintuitive, but having a small emergency fund can be a huge help when trying to get out of debt. Even if it’s $1,000 in the bank to pay for an emergency, that cash will give you some breathing room to stay on your debt diet.
Act Now
If you don&#8217;t already have one, it&#8217;s time to get your emergency fund started!
Come up with a plan to get at least $1,000 in a savings account as quickly as possible. Think about what you have available or what you can do to bring in extra money right now.

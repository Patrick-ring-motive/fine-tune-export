Who needs to be informed of your death? Do you have funeral wishes? Detail them in your letter of instruction.
A letter of instruction is not a formal legal document, but it can help reduce complexities for those you leave behind when you pass. It is a summary of essential information that you prepare to clarify your wishes concerning personal and financial matters.
Here are some items to consider:
The names of those who will need to be notified of your death
What is to be done immediately following your death
Instructions for your funeral and obituary
Directions for handling important financial matters that may need immediate attention.
An inventory of investments, insurance policies and other personal financial matters, such as debts you owe, or money owed to you
Locations of valuable documents, such as wills, trusts, deeds, military records, Social Security Number/Card, birth, adoption or marriage certificates, divorce decrees and disposition instructions for personal property
Location of important financial documents: property titles or deeds, tax returns, bank and investment statements, long-term care, medical and auto insurance policies
List of organizations in which you belong or are a paying member such as professional organizations, boards, country or golf clubs, social or political clubs
List of necessary usernames, passwords and PIN numbers to key accounts, social media, and combinations to a safe or keys to a lockbox
Key Takeaway: Keep your letter of instruction updated since the information is likely to change over time. It is recommended that you store this information in a secure location accessible to family members.
